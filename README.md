# Mentor-Link-App-Interface-Design-by-Sketch
I did this in a three people team, as the final project of the UX Design bootcamp class @ Code Berkeley. I was the team lead.
Below is the road map we had for designing this app. 

#Note that this is just a Interface Design prototype, it was not functional or operational. 




# What?

Mentor Linkâ€‹ is a social platform connecting high school students in Oakland who are interested in tech field with mentors in the tech field.

7) Connect with mentor through chat

# Where?

Home, school, public transportation, etc.
* The locations might be noisy and they might get distracted easily.

# When?

Most probably during their last year in highschool, close to the time that they should submit their applications for colleges/universities.
* They are going to use the app a couple of times during the week for a limited period of time     (few months at most).

# Why?

# Emotions/Direction: 
The unknown brings fear and anxiety. The more a student knows about the available options, the less scary and more reachable they become. 

Most teenagers are already stressed out about what path they should follow after high to reach their ideal life in the future. Connecting with a mentor in their desired field can give them an overview of the mindset and lifestyle they are going to have if they pursue the path.

# Needs:
There are lots of pressure on high schoolers during their last two years in high school. They should decide on the field that they want to continue their education in, they have to figure out which schools or courses to apply to and the deadlines to submit their application. Mentor link can speeden up the first two steps for them to be able to submit the applications on time.

# Perception: 
Talking to real people in their desired field can give them more perception of what their stepping into.

# Awareness:

Teacher- parent conferences
Online/internet
School counseling
School newspaper
Flyers

# Motivation:
Explore their field of interest more thoroughly
Save time
Find different options for pursuing a field in Tech
Learn about the skill set they need
Learn how their lifestyle will look like
